Event schema for the void-walker announcement bus (Active Domain Cartography input).

Blueprint alignment:
- Use void equations for traversal/measuring: walkers traverse using your RE-VGSP/GDSP deltas
  and publish compact observations only (no W dumps).
- ADC consumes only these observations to maintain territories/boundaries incrementally.
- This keeps introspection cost proportional to the number of announcements, not to N.

Kinds:
- "region_stat": aggregate stats for a small visited set (mean/var over W, mean coupling S_ij)
- "boundary_probe": evidence of a low-coupling cut between neighborhoods (candidate boundary)
- "cycle_hit": a loop was closed during a walk (B1 proxy event)
- "novel_frontier": sustained novelty ridge / new subdomain frontier

Notes:
- All floats are plain Python floats to keep JSON-friendly if logged.
- nodes is small (sampled IDs visited during the walk). Keep it compact (<= ~64).
