Lock-free announcement bus for void-walker observations (ADC input).

Blueprint alignment:
- Walkers traverse with void equations and publish compact Observation packets.
- ADC consumes only these announcements to maintain territories/boundaries incrementally.
- Cost is proportional to number of announcements, not to graph size.

Usage
- Producer (connectome walkers):
    bus.publish(observation)
- Consumer (Nexus/ADC loop):
    batch = bus.drain(max_items=2048)

Behavior
- Bounded deque with overwrite-on-full semantics (drop oldest) to keep runtime stable.
