## Key Highlights

* All modules and scouts must operate strictly locally, avoiding global scans, dense conversions, and direct access to raw weight arrays or external graph libraries to ensure bounded and efficient computation.
* Maps and scouts are required to maintain bounded working sets and adhere to strict resource limits, including `head_k`, `keep_max`, TTLs, and per-tick time budgets, with explicit pruning strategies to manage memory.
* The system architecture is primarily event-driven, with scouts emitting small, foldable events and maps processing these events to update their state, fostering decoupled and reactive information flow.
* Scouts are strictly read-only entities, must not mutate the connectome, and are designed to communicate results solely by emitting events, thereby preserving the integrity of the underlying graph structure.
* The `runner` module, particularly `run_scouts_once`, functions as a stateless, per-tick executor that meticulously manages scout execution within strict microsecond time budgets, ensures fairness via round-robin rotation, and is responsible for publishing all collected events.
* Various specialized maps, including `ColdMap`, `HeatMap`, `ExcitationMap`, `InhibitionMap`, `MemoryMap`, and `TrailMap`, are designed to track and expose distinct localized activity patterns such as coldness, recency, excitation, inhibition, memory, and repulsion.
* Scouts like `CycleHunterScout`, `FrontierScout`, `HeatScout`, and `MemoryRayScout` utilize sophisticated, local-only heuristics and map-driven priority sets to intelligently guide their traversals and neighbor selection within the graph.

## Next Steps & Suggestions

* Evaluate the scalability and performance of `BaseDecayMap` pruning mechanisms and `keep_max` thresholds under varying graph sizes and event loads to ensure bounded resource consumption.
* Conduct empirical studies to quantify the effectiveness of specific scout heuristics (e.g., `FrontierScout` for boundaries, `CycleHunterScout` for short cycles, `MemoryRayScout` for memory steering) in achieving their stated exploration goals across diverse graph topologies.
* Develop a systematic framework for tuning the numerous behavioral parameters (e.g., gain values, `half_life_ticks`, `tau`, `theta_mem`) to optimize for desired system outcomes, such as exploration efficiency or map accuracy.
* Investigate the robustness and consistency of the entire event propagation pipeline, from scout emission and `run_scouts_once` execution (including time budgets and fairness) to event bus handling and map folding, particularly concerning the single source of truth for the 'slow memory field'.
