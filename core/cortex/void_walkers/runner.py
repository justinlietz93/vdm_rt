vdm_rt.core.cortex.void_walkers.runner

Stateless, per-tick scout executor (void-faithful, no schedulers).
- Runs a bounded list of read-only scouts exactly once per tick.
- Enforces a micro time budget (microseconds) across all scouts.
- Accepts optional seeds (e.g., recent UTE indices) and map heads (heat/exc/inh/cold).
- Emits only foldable events (vt_touch, edge_on, optional spike/delta_w); no writes.

Usage (in runtime loop per tick):
    from vdm_rt.core.cortex.void_walkers.runner import run_scouts_once as _run_scouts_once
    evs = _run_scouts_once(connectome, scouts, maps, budget, bus, max_us)

Notes:
- No timers, no cadence, no background threads. This is a pure function called once per tick.
- Drop-oldest behavior is delegated to the downstream bus implementation when publish_many is used.
