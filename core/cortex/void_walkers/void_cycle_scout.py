vdm_rt.core.cortex.void_walkers.void_cycle_scout

CycleHunterScout (read-only, void-faithful):
- Seeks short cycles (3-6 hops) using a TTL-limited walk with a tiny path window.
- Purely local: only neighbor lists are read; no global scans or dense conversions.
- Emits vt_touch and edge_on events; reducers can infer cycle hits from returned edge traces.

Heuristic:
- Maintain a small deque of the recent path (window ~ 5).
- Prefer stepping to a neighbor that is already in the recent window (closes a short cycle).
- Otherwise, hop randomly (blue-noise) among neighbors.

Guardrails:
- No schedulers; executes once per tick under the runner.
- Bounded budgets: visits, edges, ttl.
- No writes; events only.
