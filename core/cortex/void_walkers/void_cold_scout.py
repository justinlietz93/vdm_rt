vdm_rt.core.cortex.void_walkers.void_cold_scout

ColdScout (read-only, void-faithful):
- Prefers neighbors whose node ids appear in ColdMap snapshot head ("cold_head").
- Emits only vt_touch and edge_on events.
- No scans of global structures; uses local neighbor reads and bounded TTL/budgets.

Compatibility:
- Provides alias VoidColdScoutWalker for existing imports in legacy code paths.
