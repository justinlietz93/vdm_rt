Module: vdm_rt.core.cortex.maps.trailmap
Purpose: Short half-life trail/repulsion map updated only by events (void-faithful, no scans).

Design:
- Event-driven only; folds vt_touch and edge_on into a fast-decaying accumulator.
- Intended as a light repulsion field to discourage immediate retracing (fan-out).
- Bounded working set via BaseDecayMap.keep_max (no global scans).

Snapshot keys:
- trail_head: top-k [[node, score], ...]
- trail_dict: bounded dict {node: score} over current working set (len ≤ keep_max)
