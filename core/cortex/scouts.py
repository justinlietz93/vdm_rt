vdm_rt.core.cortex.scouts (facade)

This module is now a thin aggregator that re-exports modular scout classes and maps.
It preserves legacy import paths while enforcing void-faithful, read-only traversal.

Key points:
- No global scans; scouts only use local neighbor reads and bounded TTL/budgets.
- This facade exposes:
    * VoidColdScoutWalker (ColdScout)
    * HeatScout, ExcitationScout, InhibitionScout
    * ColdMap (from maps.coldmap)
    * BaseScout (interface) via void_walkers.base
    * GDSPActuator / RevGSP re-exported from core.neuroplasticity (for legacy imports)

Contract compliance:
- Scouts emit only foldable events: vt_touch, edge_on, and (optionally) spike(+/-)
- They do not mutate the connectome (read-only), no scans, no schedulers.
