"""
Runtime orchestrator seam (Phase B): move-only adapter that preserves behavior.

Goals:
- Freeze the orchestrator-facing API now with a clean core boundary.
- Do NOT change behavior: default run-path delegates to the existing Nexus.run().
- Provide pass-throughs to the CoreEngine seam for snapshot/engram ops.
- Keep IO/emitters/telemetry packaging out of core; this module does not serialize JSON.

Policy:
- This module may import core.* but must not import io.* emitters directly.
- The actual per-tick logic remains inside Nexus until Phase C/D migration.

    Thin façade over the existing Nexus instance.

    Behavior:
    - run(): delegates 1:1 to Nexus.run() to guarantee parity.

    - snapshot(): returns a minimal numeric snapshot from CoreEngine (used by telemetry packagers).
    - read_bus(): drains announce-bus events from the underlying Nexus (for ADC folds at higher layers).
    - engram_load/save(): pass-through to CoreEngine helpers which call legacy functions internally.
