RuntimeState: small, explicit runtime context container.

Goals:
- Provide a stable place for lightweight runtime-scoped state (tick counters, RNG seed, small ring buffers),
  independent of Nexus internals. This helps freeze the seam while migrating logic out of Nexus.
- No I/O, logging, or JSON formatting here. Pure Python data only.

Usage:
- Orchestrator/Nexus may optionally hold an instance to track tick/time and share small buffers
  across helpers (telemetry, auditors, scouts). This module does not perform any scheduling.

Constraints:
- Keep memory footprint small; do not store large tensors or model state.
- Pure utility; not required for existing runs (parity preserved when unused).
