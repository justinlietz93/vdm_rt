Maps frames ring buffer (drop-oldest, thread-safe, void-faithful).

Canonical location: vdm_rt.io.visualization.maps_ring

Purpose
- Provide a tiny, bounded ring for maps frames (header+payload) with drop-oldest semantics.
- Decouples producers (telemetry/core engine) from consumers (UI/websocket) without scans.
- O(1) amortized operations; no full-buffer copies; copies only payload bytes as provided.

Contract
- Frame header schema is producer-defined; commonly:
  {topic, ver?, tick, n, shape, channels, dtype, endianness, stats, ...}
- Payload is a bytes-like buffer; typically planar blocks (e.g., Float32 LE: heat|exc|inh).

Usage
- nx._maps_ring = MapsRing(capacity=int(os.getenv("MAPS_RING", 3)))
- Producer: nx._maps_ring.push(tick, header, payload)
- Consumer: ring.latest(), ring.drain(max_items)

Security / Backpressure
- Always drops the oldest on overflow.
- Readers can choose to read only latest() to avoid client backlog.
