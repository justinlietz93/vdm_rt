vdm_rt.tests.core.test_runner_budget

CI: Verify the void-walker runner is one-shot per tick and enforces microsecond budgets.

- No schedulers, no timers: pure function invoked once per tick by runtime loop.
- Global time guard must drop remaining scouts upon exceeding max_us.
- Rotation by budget["tick"] provides fairness (round-robin start index).

This test uses a deterministic monkeypatch of runner.perf_counter_ns to avoid flaky wall-clock timings.
